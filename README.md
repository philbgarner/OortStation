# Oort Station

Oort Station is a Love2D game written in lua.

## Premise

Hundreds of years from now, humanity has spread beyond the Kuiper Belt and
into the Oort Cloud itself.  Oort Station was established with the intention
of stimulating development in the outer reaches of the Solar System,
and a sort-of futuristic Wild-West frontier begins to develop.

The player starts in control of a Salvager Class ship equipped with a mining
laser to start earning money to purchase ever stronger weapons and better
classes of ships.

AI players will grow and develop over time to become powerful adversaries
and wealthy traders in their own right.  Some may even turn privateer.

## Controls

Left/Right arrow keys to steer.

Up/Down arrow keys to increase/decrease the throttle setting. (Negative
throttle means the front thrusters are engaged).

Number keys select the weapon slot, SPACE key activates the weapon/mining
beam against the targeted asteroid/ship.

N key selects a different target.

D key docks with a space station when you're within range.

ESC key returns from menus/undocks from a station.

## Gameplay

10000x10000 pixels of play area is inside each sector (-5000 to 5000), fly
outside those boundaries in any direction to leave the current sector.

Aseteroids don't tend to appear in the home sector (5, 5). Mining asteroids
is an easy early-game way to earn Credits.

Periodic waves of immigrants and supplies will arrive in Oort Station from the
Solar System.  When other stations are built a lucrative trade transporting
these passengers can be had.

Bounty Hunting/Privateering can also be lucrative, when trade and travel 
picks up and pirates begin to operate in the area.

Players can eventually build stations that earn income through their commerce.
Tax rate is configurable.  Factory Stations can be built which create
industrial and/or military supplies.  Shipyard Stations can be built to
launch new vessels.
